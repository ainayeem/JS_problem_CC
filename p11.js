// ------------------------ Hoisting -----------------------------------------
// Hhoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.

// ------------------------ Variable Hoisting Example -------------------------
console.log(msg); // Output: undefined
var msg = "Hello Me"; // Variable declaration is hoisted to the top
console.log(msg); // Output: "Hello, world!"

// --> Explanation:
// Even though the variable message is used before its declaration, JavaScript doesn't throw an error.
// During execution, the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of the scope, and its initial value is undefined until it's assigned the value "Hello, world!" later.

// -------------------------- Function Hoisting Example --------------------------
sayHello();
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
// Output: "Hello!"

// --> Explanation:
// The function sayHello() is called before its declaration, but JavaScript doesn't throw an error.
// This is because function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope during compilation, allowing them to be called anywhere within the scope.

// -------------------------- Function Expression Hoisting Example ------------------------
sayHi();
var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Say Hi func!");
};
// Output: TypeError: sayHi is not a function

// --> Explanation:
// Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted in the same way.
// Only the variable declaration (var sayHi) is hoisted to the top of its scope, but the assignment of the function expression to the variable remains in its original position.
// Therefore, when we try to call sayHi before its assignment, we get a TypeError because sayHi is not yet a function.

// ----------------------- Hoisting behavior with let and const ------------------------------
// Variables declared with let and const are hoisted to the top of their scope like var, but they are not initialized until their actual declaration is reached.
// This means that trying to access a let or const variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.

// ----------------- Example --------------------
console.log(x);
let x = 10;
// Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
